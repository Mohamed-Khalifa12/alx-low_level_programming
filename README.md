# alx-low_level_programming
Welcome to the alx-low_level_programming repository! This repository contains the materials and assignments for the low-level programming track of Alx programming company's curriculum. The goal of this track is to teach you the fundamentals of the C programming language and how to use it to write efficient, low-level code.

## Prerequisites
Before you start this track, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some experience with at least one programming language. You should also have access to a computer with a C compiler installed, such as GCC or Clang.

## Curriculum
The low-level programming track consists of several modules, each covering a different aspect of C programming. Here's an overview of the modules:

1. Introduction to C programming
2. Data types and operators
3. Control flow
4. Functions and pointers
5. Arrays and strings
6. Structures and dynamic memory allocation
7. File I/O
8. Makefiles and debugging
9. Preprocessor and macros
10. Static and dynamic libraries
11. Bit manipulation

Each module includes a set of assignments and exercises that will help you practice the concepts covered in the module. You should complete these assignments before moving on to the next module.
